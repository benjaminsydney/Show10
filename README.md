A Swift app designed for iPhone that shows 10 restaurants nearby given a UK postcode using the Just Eat API.

## 🏁 Getting Started

You will need Xcode to run this app on your local machine. The app was developed using Xcode 16.2 on a Macbook Pro running macOS 15.3.2.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following things to run the application:

- Xcode running on a Mac
- Internet connection
- **[Optional]** Test iOS device

You will then need to:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the repository in Xcode

### Installing

1. Select either a test iOS device as the build target or generic iOS device (e.g. iPhone 16)
2. Build the app using the ► button in the top of Xcode

The app should load onto the build device for you to use.

I felt that TestFlight was overkill for the app in its current state.

## 📱 Using the app

To use the app, simply open the application on your iOS device, choose whether you want the first 10 results of the API or the closest 10 results to the postcode, type in a UK postcode to the search field. Push the magnifying glass and if the API finds results, you will be taken to the 10 restaurants.

## 📝 The Assignment

The assignment was clear. To produce code that returned the following data for a given UK postcode using the Just Eat API:

- Restaurant Name
- Restaurant Cuisines
- Restaurant Rating - as a number
- Restaurant Address

Additionally, I have made some assumptions, namely, that using other data from the API is allowed, even if there are only 4 assessed metrics. Therefore, I'm pulling in the restaurant logo and coordinates to give further information to users.

## 🤩 Standout features

### 🗺️ Map View

The app brings up a Map using MapKit to display the coordinates of the 10 restaurants. Allowing users to quickly visualise their options.

### ⭐️ Star Rating

The app not only displays the restaurant rating as a number (as expected) but also fills in that many stars to help users quickly visualise how well rated a location is.

### 🎨 Background Animation

The app uses JET colors (from the Just Eat Brand Box) to create a moving linear background for the start screen and these colours are used throughout the app to cement it's ties to Just Eat's strong branding.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

The app is built in **Swift** using **SwiftUI** for the UI. Network calls are handled asynchronously using `async/await`. The app is designed for iPhones running iOS however, in my test the app runs well on iPads running iPadOS too.

## 🔮 Future Work

There are many improvements I'd like to complete in the future if I have more time. Here are some of them:

### Re-enter postcode for new results

My original vision for the app involved having both a TextField and the back button in the PostcodeSearchBar in ResultsView. This could allow users to retype the entered postcode and immediately get taken to the new results instead of returning to the PostcodeEntry view.

However, in development it became clear there wasn't a reliable way to get the Map to update without completely redrawing it or using MKCoordinateRegion and creating a cameraView, but I haven't worked with that before, so further time is needed to research & integrate. I therefore adapted the PostcodeSearchBar to morph into a back button, forcing users to search for postcodes one at a time.

### API results questions

When the API is queried with a postcode, it returns a large number of restaurants around that area in (seemingly) no particular order. Therefore, I was unsure whether to build the app to get strictly the 'first' 10 results from the API or sort the results and get the closest in driving terms to the postcode.

In order to stay safe, I added a toggle for the user. By default, strictly the first 10 results the API responds with are listed. But the user can switch to get the closest 10 if preferred.

In the future, further clarification of the purpose of the app could remove this toggle completely simplifying the app.

### Cuisine Tags

My original vision for the app had the individual cuisine tags wrap around the restaurant container limitlessly. I knew I had to prepare a design that worked for an unlimited number of cuisines of an undefined character limit and felt this wrap design worked best.

However, in development I found there wasn't an easy way to do this natively in Swift. My research led me to FlowLayout but I hadn't designed one before and would need more time to integrate. Therefore, I implemented a simple ScrollView to hold the tags. This allows all tags to show no matter the cuisine string length nor number of cuisines per restaurant.

The only downside is that now the user has two different horizontally scrolling UI views. A TabView holding restaurants and a ScrollView on each restaurant for the cuisines.

To remedy, I attempted using .rotationEffect() on the TabView and then rotating individual restaurants to produce a vertically scrolling restaurant with horizontally scrolling cuisines. But because this is 'faking' the verticality, when you scroll to the end of a Cuisine ScrollView the TabView would move with the residual force of the scroll which felt wrong.

Given more time, I could redesign the restaurant container or investigate FlowLayout to get a permanent solution.

### Z-Index Annotations
There seems to be no easy way to give the map annotations a Z-Index value or group annotations if they will be 'collide'. As a result, the numbered placement tags on the map sometimes occlude each other. If a user swipes through the restaurant cards, the selected restaurant’s annotation is enlarged but sometimes remains occluded behind other annotations. However, if a directly user taps on an map annotation, the larger annotation is drawn and it does consistently comes to the front. Only swiping through the cards has this problem on the map.

Further investigation is needed to find a work around this.

### Linear Gradient Animation
The animated background of PostcodeEntry uses some of the JET-recommended brand colors to produce a modern animated background but it seems to stutter for a second upon first-load of the app and I theorize this may be why.

I know it's possible to preload animations, this could improve performance but I don't have the experience yet to do this so haven't implemented here. Alternatively, I could render the background as a video and compare performance of having a video background instead. This would, of course, increase the size of the app.
